  <p><strong>Dear Attorney General,</strong></p>

  <p><strong>We write to express our grave concern about Israel’s escalating assault on the people of Gaza.</strong></p>

  <p>Since 7 October 2023, Israel has killed more than 30,000 Palestinians, including over 12,000 children, and wounded over 70,000. The UN has warned that at least 576,000 people in Gaza are “one step away from famine.”</p>

  <p><strong>We are especially alarmed by the UK government’s continued arms exports to Israel and the failure to meet the UK’s legal obligation to prevent genocide.</strong></p>

  <p>Under the Genocide Convention, the UK has a clear duty to prevent genocide, not just punish it. The International Court of Justice ruled in January that there is a plausible risk of genocide in Gaza. The UK must therefore act to stop arms sales to Israel and ensure it is not complicit in genocide.</p>

  <p><strong>We are asking you to urgently investigate whether government ministers have failed in their domestic and international law obligations, and whether there are grounds for prosecution.</strong></p>

  <p>Specifically, we urge you to investigate:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The lawfulness of continuing arms exports to Israel in the light of the ICJ ruling and credible reports of serious violations of international law by Israeli forces.</li>
    <li>Whether any UK officials or ministers may be complicit in genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity in Gaza.</li>
    <li>Whether the UK government has failed in its duty under international law to prevent genocide.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>We believe there is enough evidence to merit investigation, and that such an investigation is in the public interest.</strong></p>

  <p>We look forward to your response.</p>

  <p><strong>Yours sincerely,</strong></p>,\n` + sig;

  let dppBody = `I am writing to seek clarification regarding the Crown Prosecution Service’s position on the application of the Terrorism Act 2000 in relation to political expression and protest concerning Palestine.

On Monday 14 July 2025 at approximately 17:30, a peaceful protester, Laura Morton, was approached by Kent Police while holding a Palestinian flag and stating “Free Palestine” at St George’s roundabout in Canterbury. Officers informed her that such actions could be construed as support for a proscribed terrorist organisation, and warned her that she could be arrested under the Terrorism Act if she refused to provide her name or continued expressing similar views.

One officer was recorded stating:

“Mentioning freedom of Gaza, Israel, genocide… will come under prescribed groups, which are terror groups… dictated by the government.”

Kent Police later released a public statement saying:

“Under the Terrorism Act it is a criminal offence to carry or display items that may arouse reasonable suspicion that an individual is a member or supporter of a proscribed organisation such as Palestine Action.”

Given the CPS's role in guiding prosecutions and advising on the public interest, I respectfully request clarification on the following points:

1. Threshold for Reasonable Suspicion
Does the CPS consider it lawful or proportionate for police to interpret the display of a national flag or the expression of slogans such as “Free Palestine” as sufficient to arouse reasonable suspicion of support for a proscribed group?

2. CPS Guidance to Police and Prosecutors
Has the CPS issued, or is it considering issuing, any guidance to ensure that peaceful protest and expressions of solidarity with Palestine are not misinterpreted as criminal conduct under counter-terrorism legislation?

3. Freedom of Expression
Given the protections under Article 10 of the Human Rights Act 1998 and the European Convention on Human Rights, how does the CPS ensure that public prosecutors distinguish between:

Lawful political expression and dissent, and

Unlawful support for proscribed organisations?

4. Clarification of Legal Standards
Would the CPS consider issuing public-facing clarification to help prevent further chilling effects on protest, especially in cases where expressions of identity or political solidarity are being conflated with extremism?

Request
I respectfully ask whether the Crown Prosecution Service intends to:

Clarify its prosecutorial standards with respect to peaceful political protest; and

Prevent misuse of anti-terrorism laws against individuals who express general support for Palestine without any affiliation with proscribed groups.

This issue raises serious concerns about the balance between public safety and fundamental rights. I believe it is essential that prosecutorial discretion is exercised transparently and proportionately to maintain public confidence in the justice system.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Yours sincerely,\n` + sig;
